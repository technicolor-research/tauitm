# Time-Aware User Identification with Topic Models (TAUITM) #


## Description ##

Accounts are often shared by multiple users, each of them having different item consumption and temporal habits.
Identifying the active user can lead to improvements in a variety of services by switching from account personalized services to user personalized services. To do so, we develop a topic model extending the Latent Dirichlet Allocation using a hidden variable representing the active user and assuming consumption times to be generated by latent time topics. We also create a new dataset of composite accounts from real users to
test the identification capabilities of our model.
